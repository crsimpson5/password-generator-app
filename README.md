## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass

### What I learned

For this project I created custom inputs including a range slider and checkboxes. I learned how to import SVG sprites and change their properties with CSS.

### Useful resources

- [SVG Sprites](https://svgsprit.es/) - Helped with importing SVGs instead of adding them directly in the markup
